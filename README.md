## Daktari Online Software Developer Position Interview

We have provided a list of questions that are to be attempted within `20 minutes`.
The questions are listed on the [Questions PDF](assets/Software%20Developer%20Position%20Interview%20Questions.pdf) file attatched to this repository, a contribution
guide has also been provided in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

- The descriptive questions will require code demonstrations e.g. to define css property such as `position` and its `values`, an appropriate answer would be:
```
postion: absolute, relative, static, fixed;

default: Follows document flow.
relative: Moves relative to its normal position.
absolute: Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
fixed: Positioned relative to the viewport and doesn't move with scrolling.
```
