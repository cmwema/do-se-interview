# Contributing Guidelines

This guide will showcase your proficiency in using git and subsequently help with easier access and assessment of your code.

## How to Submit/Contribute

1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.

2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/daktarionline/do-se-interview.git)
   ```

3. Create a new branch for your contribution:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b "your actual first name"
   ```

To see if you are working in a new branch, run the following command:

```bash
git branch
```

4. Add your code to a folder whose name would be your first name. For instance if my name is `haron` the final structure would be `do-se-interview/haron`

5. Include a comment at the top of the file explaining the purpose and usage of the code.

6. If your code snippet or script has any dependencies or requires specific instructions to run, please include them in the file or in a separate README file within the same directory.

7. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "descriptive commit message"
   ```

8. Push your changes to your forked repository:

```bash
   git push
```

10. Open a pull request from your forked repository to the main repository. Provide a clear title and description for your pull request, explaining the purpose and benefits of your contribution.

## Code Guidelines


- Make sure your code is well-documented and includes clear comments explaining its functionality.
- Follow the coding conventions and best practices of the respective programming language.
- Test your code thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
- Strive to be as original as possible, the goal is to assess logic, code standards and understanding of programming concepts.

## Review Process

---

Once you have submitted a pull request, we will review your code checking for completeness, originality, structure, standards and correctness.
`NOTE: Your code does not need to be entirely accurate but must show the properties described in the guidlines.`

### Happy Coding!
